                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <div class = "paragraph-border">
                    <p>
                        <b>What Is This Word Cloud Showing?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        These word clouds illustrate the frequency each item appears across the series, with each word cloud only displaying the items 
                        introduced in its respective game. The text size of the item in this word cloud directly correlates with how many games the item 
                        appears in. The text size is equivalent to the number of times the item appeared across the <i>Zelda</i> franchise multiplied by 
                        10. So, If the item only appears in the game it was introduced, it has a text size of 10, and if the item was used in 6 games across 
                        the series, such as the shovel, it will have a text size of 60.  
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class = "paragraph-border">
                    <p>
                        <b>What Can We Draw From This?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        When looking at each word cloud, you start to notice qualities about each game. For example, 
                        we can see that </i>Zelda II</i> did not have very many new items, and most of them were not used often. However, 
                        it was the game to introduce the hammer, an item used frequently in many future games, making the hammer <i>Zelda II</i>’s 
                        most notable item.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You also notice that <i>A Link to the Past</i> and <i>Ocarina of Time</i> both establish many items that continue to be used 
                        frequently in following <i>Zelda</i> games. In comparison, later <i>Zelda</i> games do not have nearly as many items that 
                        appear with such frequency. One reason for this is of course that with each game there are fewer new games following it, and 
                        so less opportunities for items to be reused (<i>Breath of the Wild</i> obviously isn’t going to have any of its new items 
                        reused). However, when looking at a game like <i>Wind Waker</i>, which has 9 games following it, only 5 of the 25 items it 
                        introduced were later reused. Perhaps more items introduced between Majora’s Mask and Breath of the Wild will be used in 
                        future games down the line, but from this data it becomes apparent that far more of <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, 
                        <i>A Link to the Past</i>, and the original <i>Legend of Zelda</i>’s items have become staples to the series than any other game’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those three classics together seem to have established many of the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> series’ staple items. 
                        Meanwhile, new games seem to focus more on creating new items for the sake of novelty. This makes sense, as <i>Zelda</i> 
                        games have a reputation for taking old, established conventions, and working in new novelties to make each game feel fresh 
                        and unique.
